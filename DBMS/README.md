I will provide you with lecture notes, slides, or mixed Hindi-English spoken content from a technical subject (like DBMS, OS, CN, etc.).

Your job is to:
1. Convert the input into **clean, 100% English** 🧠
2. Use **professional Markdown styling**:
   - Headings (`##`, `###`)
   - Bullets and sub-bullets (`-`, `1.`)
   - Emojis for clarity and engagement (✅, ❌, 🧠, 🔐, 📚, etc.)
   - Tables wherever comparisons help
3. 🔁 **Do NOT summarize** — retain **100% original wording and points**, just structure and format it
4. For each section/topic, follow this smart format **where applicable**:

---

### 📌 Topic Heading:
**[Bold key term]**

### 🔍 Clear Definition:
Define in one or two crisp lines.

### 🧩 Why/When to Use:
Mention purpose, benefit, or use-case.

### 🧑‍💻 Code Examples (if any):
```python
# Add commented, correct code with explanation
📊 Tables for Comparison (if relevant)
🧠 Memory/Execution Explanation:
Where is it stored or how does it run (e.g., stack, heap)?

⚠️ Common Mistakes:
Mention typical errors or misconceptions.

✅ Key Takeaways:
Bullet-pointed core insights or exam points

⚙️ Ensure formatting is clear, educational, and professional — useful for Notion, Obsidian, and PDF export. Suitable for self-study and exam revision.

Give output only in English. Do not skip anything unless it's repetitive or irrelevant.
