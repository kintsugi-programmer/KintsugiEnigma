### ❓ What are Data Structures?

* **Definition**:
  A data structure is a way of **organizing data in main memory** during program execution time so that it can be efficiently used by the program logic.

* **Need**:

  * Every program(Set of Instructions) performs operations on data.
  * CPU executes **program code**, which manipulates **data** stored in memory.
  * Efficient arrangement of data = **better performance** and utilization.

### 🏗 Types of Data Structures

| Type     | Examples                           | Meaning                   |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Physical | Arrays, Matrices, Linked Lists     | Actual memory arrangement |
| Logical  | Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph, Hashing | Logical usage structure   |
                  +-----+
                  | CPU |
                  +--+--+
                     |
        +-----------------------------+
        |                             |
        |           Data              |
        |                             |
        |-----------------------------|
        |        Program Code         |
        +-----------------------------+
                  Main Memory

> 📌 Physical = Memory Layout(Physical Arrangement); Logical = Usage Strategy(Utilization)

### ❓ Why Study Data Structures?

* **Academic Requirement**: Core subject in CS/IT curriculum.
* **Industrial Importance**: Used in all software development and application logic.
* **Foundation for Algorithms**: Efficient algorithms rely on correct data structures.

### 📈 Levels of Learning Data Structures

| Level       | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Level 1** | Understand basic working and usage of data structures        |
| **Level 2** | Deep understanding + complexity analysis (Time/Space)        |
| **Level 3** | Able to **implement from scratch** in a programming language |

✅ **This course covers up to Level 3**

### 🧑‍💻 Programming Language Used

* **Used in Course**: C and C++

* **Why C?**

  * C does **not have built-in data structures**, so you learn to create them from scratch.
  * Close to system memory, offers **better conceptual clarity**.
  * C++ is also supported (C is a subset of C++).
  * i.e. C code can be run as CPP code.

* **Other Languages?**

  * All languages (Java, Python, C#, JavaScript) have **built-in** data structures.
  * You don't need to implement them from scratch there; just know how to **use** them.

| Language   | Built-in Structures             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| C++        | STL (Standard Template Library) |
| Java       | Collections Framework           |
| Python     | Lists, Dictionaries, Sets       |
| JavaScript | Arrays, Objects, DOM            |

### 🚀 Organization of Course Content

1. **Recursion** – Covered first, due to its importance in DS.
2. **Brush-up Section** – Concepts of C & C++ (functions, structures, templates, classes).
3. **Each Data Structure** – Implementation + operations + analysis.
4. **Sorting** – Covered with depth + performance analysis.

### 🔁 Why Recursion First?

* Recursion is fundamental for:

  * Trees
  * Graphs
  * Divide-and-conquer algorithms
* It’s important for **problem-solving**, even though it's less efficient in practice.
* Most real-world problems are **solved recursively** and later **converted into loops**.

🧠 **Problem Solving ≠ Programming**

* Programming: Syntax + Logic
* Problem Solving: Mathematical Thinking (Recursion is a part of it)

---

### ❓ Are Algorithms Included?

* Only **algorithms related to data structures** are covered.
* Broader algorithms (like Google’s, AI, ML, etc.) are NOT part of this course.
* For that, refer to the separate **Algorithms YouTube channel** by the same instructor.
